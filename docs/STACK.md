## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Backend | None — no custom API. TanStack Start's Nitro server (`node-server` preset) only does SSR of page shells (SPEC.md §4) |
| Frontend | TanStack Start v1.x (React 19, TanStack Router file-based routing, Vite), Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui on Base UI |
| ML runtime (client-side) | `@huggingface/transformers` v4 + ONNX Runtime Web (WebGPU / WASM), runs in a Web Worker — not server infra |
| Database | None — no persistent server-side store (SPEC.md §3). `umami-db` (Postgres) is analytics-only infra, added in Phase 05 |
| Cache | None server-side. Client-side: Service Worker (`public/sw.js`, cache-first) for model weights; `localStorage` for the quality-mode preference |
| Infra | Docker Compose: `nginx` + `app` (Phase 01); `umami` + `umami-db` added in Phase 05. Cloudflare (proxy + R2) for CDN/model-weight storage |
| Package managers | pnpm |
| CI | GitHub Actions → GitHub Container Registry → SSH deploy to VPS |

## Prerequisites

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
node --version
pnpm --version
```

---

## Initial setup

```bash
# Local dev (no Docker)
pnpm install
pnpm dev                       # vite dev — TanStack Start dev server

# Full stack via Docker Compose (nginx + app; matches production topology)
docker compose up --build -d
```

---

## Gate Commands

This section is the human-readable command source for the [`phase-gate`](playbooks/phase-gate.md)
workflow. Fill every row that applies to this project. Mark `n/a` for rows that do not apply
(e.g. no frontend → frontend rows are `n/a`). The phase-gate playbook will report `SKIPPED — n/a in
STACK.md` for those.

| Gate check | Command | Preconditions / notes |
|------------|---------|-----------------------|
| Infrastructure / bootstrap | `docker compose up --build -d app` | Needs Docker + Docker Compose. Scoped to `app` only — `nginx`+`certbot` need a real cert from `deploy/init-letsencrypt.sh`, which requires the real `cutbg.art` DNS record, so they can only be validated on the actual VPS, not in dev/CI. See "TLS / reverse-proxy verification" below. |
| Migrations | `n/a` | No database in this project (SPEC.md §3) |
| Backend / unit tests | `n/a` | No separate backend service/test suite — single TS/React codebase; all unit tests run under "Frontend unit tests" below |
| Frontend prep | `n/a` | TanStack Start generates the route tree via its Vite plugin automatically on `dev`/`build` — no separate prepare step (confirmed via TanStack Start docs, no Nuxt-style `prepare` equivalent) |
| Frontend type-check | `pnpm tsc --noEmit` | Strict mode (SPEC.md §6); mirrors the `build` step's typecheck |
| Frontend unit tests | `pnpm vitest run` | Covers `features/remove-background` unit tests + `useBackgroundRemoval` integration tests (SPEC.md §7.7) |
| E2E lint / determinism | `n/a` | No dedicated determinism-lint tool specified in SPEC.md §6; e2e spec files are covered by the project's regular `eslint.config.js` |
| E2E | `pnpm playwright test` | `@playwright/test` installed in Phase 03 with one smoke spec (`e2e/dev-remove-background.spec.ts`) covering the toggle + harness render and `localStorage` persistence, chromium-only. The full cross-browser critical-path matrix (upload → process → download, SPEC.md §7.4) lands in Phase 04. |
| Smoke | `docker compose exec -T app node -e "fetch('http://localhost:3000/').then(r=>process.exit(r.ok?0:1)).catch(()=>process.exit(1))"` | Deterministic, container-network-native — doesn't need port 3000 published to the host or TLS/nginx up. `app` also has a Docker `healthcheck` (docker-compose.yml) doing the same check on a 10s interval; `docker compose ps app` should show `(healthy)`. Phase files may override with a phase-specific check. |

Architecture lint (run in CI before tests, not part of the standard gate rows above — SPEC.md §7.7):

```bash
pnpm exec steiger ./src
```

### TLS / reverse-proxy verification (VPS-only, not part of the automated gate)

`nginx` + `certbot` can only be brought up successfully after `deploy/init-letsencrypt.sh` has run
once against the real `cutbg.art` DNS record (see `docker-compose.yml` comments) — that's a
deploy-time precondition no dev machine or CI runner can satisfy. Verify this path manually on the
VPS after deploy: `docker compose ps` shows `nginx` and `certbot` up, and `https://cutbg.art/`
resolves with a valid certificate in a browser.

No project helper script exists yet for `phase-gate` orchestration — add
`./scripts/phase-gate.sh [XX]` here if one is introduced later.

## Testing

### Backend

None — no backend test suite (no server-side API beyond SSR shells, SPEC.md §4).

### Frontend

```bash
pnpm tsc --noEmit          # type-check, strict mode
pnpm vitest run            # unit + integration (Testing Library for hooks)
pnpm exec steiger ./src    # FSD architecture lint — run before tests in CI
pnpm playwright test       # e2e critical path + cross-browser matrix (SPEC.md §7.4)
```
