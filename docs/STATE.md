## Phase Status

| Phase    | Status     | Tag    | Gate | Impl By | Notes |

| PHASE_01 | ✅ done | v0.01.0 | ✅ | 🤖 agent | Scaffold |

## Current Contract

> Technical contract as of the latest completed phase. Append-only — never remove an entry unless
> `SPEC.md` explicitly removes it (via `/spec-sync`). Updated by `/spec-sync` (on contract-changing
> spec edits) and `/context-update` (on phase completion).

**Phase completed:** `01` · **Phase in progress:** `—`

**Stack:** see [docs/STACK.md](./STACK.md)

### Core Models

None yet.

### Active Endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Response / Payload |
|--------|------|------|---------------------|
| `GET` | `/` | none | SSR HTML page shell ("hello world" placeholder; full home composition arrives in Phase 04) |

### DB Schema

- Tables: none yet.
- Current migration head: `—`

### UI Pages

- `/` — hello-world placeholder (Phase 01). Replaced by the full `pages/home` composition in Phase 04.

### Env Config

| Key | Example value | Required |
|-----|---------------|----------|
| `PORT` | `3000` | no — Nitro `node-server` preset default |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | no — standard Node convention for the container build |

### DB Seeds

None yet.

## Active Blockers

## Project Log

> Append-only, newest entry first. One entry format for everything that used to be split across
> `CHANGELOG.md` entries, `DECISIONS.md` ADRs, and the old "Expert Feedback Log" / "Rollback
> Notes" sections. Never delete an entry — if a decision is superseded, add a new entry that says
> so and leave the old one in place.

## 2026-07-10 — Phase 01 complete

**Type**: phase-completion
**Author**: AI (context-update)
**Triggered by**: PHASE_01 gate passed

### Changes / Decision
- TanStack Start scaffolded (Vite, Nitro `node-server` preset, TypeScript strict), FSD layer
  skeleton, ESLint + Prettier, Steiger architecture lint, Husky + lint-staged
- Hello-world page at `/`, proving the SSR pipeline end to end
- Dockerfile, docker-compose (`app` + `nginx` + `certbot`), Nginx reverse proxy, Certbot TLS
  bootstrap (`deploy/init-letsencrypt.sh`), GitHub Actions CI (lint → typecheck → arch-lint →
  test → build → push to GHCR → SSH deploy)
- Gate commands in `docs/STACK.md` scoped to what's actually testable in dev/CI (`app` container
  directly); `nginx`/TLS verification documented as a VPS-only manual step

### Affected Phases / Consequences
- None (additive change — first phase)

---

## v1.0 — 2026-07-09 — Initial Setup

**Type**: phase-completion
**Author**: `v.godlevskiy`
**Triggered by**: Project initialization with SDD workflow

### Changes
- `SPEC.md` created: project goals, roles, data model, API/contract, phase plan
- `STACK.md` populated with build/test/run commands

### Affected Phases / Consequences
- None (initial state)

ENTRY TEMPLATE — copy this block when adding a new entry. Pick the Type that fits:
  spec-change      — docs/SPEC.md changed (via /spec-sync)
  phase-completion — a phase closed out (via /context-update)
  decision         — an architectural decision / trade-off (ADR-style, manual or agent-recorded)
  feedback         — human reviewer or domain-expert feedback on a phase
  rollback         — a phase was rolled back or a migration reversed
